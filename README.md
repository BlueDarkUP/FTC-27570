## 📂 Repository Overview

This repository contains the public FTC code for the **"INTO THE DEEP"** (2024-2025) season. Our code is designed to handle complex tasks in the competition, and we hope it can be useful for other teams!

---

## 💻 Our Code

Our code is based on **Android Studio** and utilizes **Roadrunner** for motion planning. To get the best results, we recommend you first get familiar with **Roadrunner**.  
In this season’s challenge, our robot performs tasks like completing four chambers and put four baskets during the autonomous period, allowing us to score 83 points for chamber and 67 for basket
We used the simplest network camera: **Logitech C270**, and integrated the advantages of both by using our own **OpenCV** visual pipeline and **Roadrunner** to achieve fully automatic capture

### 🚀 Key Features:
- **Android Studio** for development
- **Roadrunner** for motion control
- **OpenCV** for fully automatic grasping visual program
- Optimized for autonomous tasks and performance
